* Conceptually what's happening on the surface
```on the fuzzy search is that algorith is search for statistically closest [object] [word] [entity] [anything else] but mostly characters which all has their unique code that can be summed up by closeness and relation to each other, but other thing is that it can match the pattern  ```
what implementation states are needed at the begginning:
1. control over and fetching local files (since it's linux everything is a file so it should be easier)
2. general directory and parent directory control
3. interface (either gui or tui or 'cli' if possible) for controlling and interacting with backend
4. algorithm that can be utilized best for specific search that's efficient and accurate
